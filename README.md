# Food delivery app backend
This repository contains the backend of a food delivery app. An online food delivery app aims to deliver food from restaurants to customers at a location of their choice in a safe, fast and efficient manner. This combines convenience of the customer with a manifold increase in the reach of a restaurant. To do this, it involves onboarding restaurants, delivery agents and customers.  Online food delivery apps are a successful business model, two of the most famous examples are Zomato and Swiggy. In this model, we have divided the use for two separate users, the customer ordering the food, and the restaurant owner setting up and updating a restaurant menu.

## Customer user flow
- Customer logs in (In the future we will use spring security, but for now we are using our own custom login functionality)
- Customer browses all the restaurants, categories or featured items
- On clicking an item it gets added to cart and they can either checkout or keep browsing
- Once the selection has been completed the customer reviews the order, checks out and pays the bill
- On completion they are redirected to the home page



## Restaurant owner user flow
- Owner logs in (In the future we will use spring security, but for now we are using our own custom login functionality)
- Owner accesses the restaurant owner page and can perform crud operations on the dishes being sold

## Tech stack
