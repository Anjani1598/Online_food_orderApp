# Food delivery app backend
This repository contains a functional clone of a food delivery app. Online food delivery apps are a major business model. An online food delivery app aims to provide food to customers in a safe, fast and efficient manner. To do this, it involves onboarding restaurants, delivery agents and customers. 2 of the most famous examples are Zomato and Swiggy. In this, we have divided the use for 2 separate users, the customer ordering the food, and the restaurant owner setting up and updating a restaurant.

## Customer user flow
- Customer logs in (In the future we will use spring security, but for now we are using our own custom login functionality)
- Customer browses all the restaurants, categories or featured items
- On clicking an item it gets added to cart and they can either checkout or keep browsing
- Once the selection has been completed the customer reviews the order, checks out and pays the bill
- On completion they are redirected to the home page



## Restaurant owner user flow
- Owner logs in (In the future we will use spring security, but for now we are using our own custom login functionality)
- Owner accesses the restaurant owner page and can perform crud operations on the dishes being sold
